# Bikepacking the Green Mountains: Retrospective

## Overview

I've been thinking casually about bikepacking for a while now, and during the long 4th of July weekend I decided to finally plan an experimental trip. This was actually my second bikepacking trip, but the first was a relatively simple out-and-back in the Idaho wilderness.

Planning extended bikepacking trips is more complex in the Northeast because you inevitably need to travel on roads which are shared by cars. It's difficult to plan routes with good elevation, reasonable seclusion, interesting landmarks, safe roadways, etc. This article is a summary of my planning and a post-op reflection on the experience.
