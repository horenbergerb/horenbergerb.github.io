### Intuitive Mathematics: Theoretical and Educational Implications

* Chapter 1
    - Physics intuitions are often incorrect i.e. Aristotelian conceptualization of motion
    - Many math inuitions are also incorrect, i.e. statistics
    - Some math is learned procedurally, but the "underlying teleology" is missed
        * i.e. algebraic operations like matrix math
    - Mathematical Intution
        * They start with two traditional views, classical and inferential, which they will then synthesize into a new definition
        - Classical Intuitionist View: intuition is dissociated from formal reasoning.
      	    * Intution is when the problem is formulated such that the answer is immediately self-evident
                - No need for justification or formal analysis is necessary
            * Related to Spinoza and Bergson
                - Intution is antithetical to reason, it's contact with prime reality
                - Intuition is not practical or applicable
            * Many modern definitions of intutions have commonalities to classical intuitionist
            * Some intution may be innate, i.e. counting in babies
        - Inferential Intutionist View: intution is a form of reasoning guided by interactions with your environment
            * Related to Ewing and Bunge
                - Intuition is the product of prior experience and reason
                - Intutition is justified belief, and the "Aha!" moment is an illusion caused by a series of rapid inferences unavailable to consciousness
                - This explains why intuition is subject to error
                - Immediacey, coherence, and confidence in solution is the result of a mini-theory or model which supports inferences based on implicit knowledge
                - New intuition can be developed
                - Fischbein is a big name in the educational literature on this topic
       * This paper categorizes intuitions into primary and secondary, similar to Fischbein
           - Primary is every-day knowledge like counting and addition. Develops in youth
               - Gelman and Meck experimentally demonstrate counting principles
	       - Children use schemas to solve arithmetic problems 
                   * Schemas organize information in a useful way (Bartlett, Schank and Abelson)
                   * Schemas include change problems, combination problems, and comparison problems (Greeno)
           - Secondary is built over long periods of formal training

  - Note: most math intuition research focuses on statistics
