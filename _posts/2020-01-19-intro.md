# What's This All About?

So this is my blog. I'm going to make it a goal to create informative, self-contained explorations on various topics of interest.
Here are some topics I'll be writing on:

* Photonics
* Physics
* Climbing
* Mathematics
* Politics
* Philosophy
* My personal life
* Your personal life
* Any field in which I don't have verifiable credentials

I'll try to get my first post up soon. It will probably either be on Photonics or literally anything else.
