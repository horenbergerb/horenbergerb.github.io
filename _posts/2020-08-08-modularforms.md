# Modular Forms: Why Does Anyone Care?

## Introduction

I hope that you, the reader, have no idea what a modular form is. This is not only to hide my own ineptitude, but also because I want to share more than just the mathematics behind modular forms. I want to motivate theoretical mathematics. I want to make you view mathematicians not as dull, spreadsheet-loving, pencil-pushing nerds, but instead as pioneering, adventure-loving, pencil-pushing nerds.

If explorers like Marco Polo or Meriwether Lewis came back and said, "you need to see this!" then mathematicians like Isaac Newton and Bernhard Riemann would have finished their theories and said, "you need glasses." They showed us that there are new ways to perceive the common experience.

To expand on this, we'll start this article by exploring how math fits into our society. We'll briefly look at who used it and how throughout history. On this go-around, we'll try to focus on why math was so pervasive rather than on the genealogy of nerds, but we will inevitably discuss some nerds.

Then, we'll set up some simple mathematical foundations. We'll use this to explain one of the main historical problems motivating modular forms.

Finally, I'll ramble a little bit about modular forms themselves. I make no guarantees about the quality of this content, and I offer no refunds. Let's get to it!

## History of Math: The Highlight Reel

### The Early Days

[*The Number Sense*, by Stanislas Dehaene][1], offers an interesting question: "How can a 5-month-old baby know that 1 plus 1 equals 2?" Stanislas goes even further by showing that many animals have some kind of "number sense," or an ability to compare quantities. For example, rats know that "2 is less than 7," and they can apply this knowledge to many situations, such as counting auditory beeps or flashes of light. Some animals can even perform simple arithmetic, and chimpanzees appear to be capable of adding fractions!

All of this is to say that math is old. It appears that 10,000 years ago creatures may have thought, "oh no, that's three wolves!" This is evolutionarily feasible; knowing approximately how many meals, friends, or enemies you have is a valuable skill.

It's not until after the invention of writing--itself a few thousand years after organized agriculture and civilization--that we see a more nuanced picture of mathematics.

In [*The History of the Ancient World*], Susan Bauer describes the earliest use of tally marks in society. "These counters had been used for as long as farmers owned cows: perhaps for centuries. But sometime before 3000 BC, the richest Sumerians (those with many, many counters to keep track of) laid their counters out on a thin sheet of clay, folded the sheet up around them, and placed a seal on the seam. When the clay dried, it formed a kind of envelope."

The development of numbers seemed intertwined with the intricacies of a growing society. Individuals had more property to keep track of, more trade deals to negotiate, and more taxes to pay (or collect). Written numerals helped to verify and communicate quantities.

There was also a blossoming awareness of geometry. The great pyramids, built around 2600 by the Egyptians, show an awareness of simple geometrical shapes, such as the square and the triangle. These shapes (and a few others) were easy to work with, since area and volume calculations involved simple multiplication. This would let farmers approximate the yield of their plot of land and architects approximate the material cost of their monuments.

Keep in mind that while architects designed using geometry, the physics appears to have been guess-and-check. According to Bauer,

"The pyramid was to have smooth and very steep sidesâ€”but partway through the construction, Snefru and his chief of works seemed to realize that their measurements were off. If the pyramid continued up at its current steep angle, the weight of the stones over the relatively narrow base would likely collapse it. So they made a quick alteration in the angle, with the result that the pyramid turned out hunch-shouldered; one of its sides makes a right-hand turn."

Finally, our last stop in the earliest history of mathematics is [Babylonia, circa 1800-1600BC][3]. This age is notable for having the first widespread occurence of nerds. Mathematical problems were being solved not just to appease an angry trading partner. In fact, there's not a clear motive at all for much of the mathematical work.

Solving the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle led to approximations of $\sqrt{2}$. Additionally, one could find problems like "I added twice the side to the square; the result is 1300. What is the side?" This is the same as finding the solutions for $x^2+2x=1300$. Why did this interest them? It's not clear that this problem had any practical application.

The Babylonian nerds are not just a historical curiosity. Although they had no clear purpose at the time, many of their mathematical methods would be inherited by future cultures and find their practical niche. In fact, many of the early mathematical curiosities would eventually have utility once we found a better way to connect our experience to math. The culmination of this concept is the mathematical theory of physics developed by Newton.

### Short Survey of Most of Human History

I don't feel like getting particularly elaborate about the period between Babylonia and Newton. No one would argue this period is unimportant, but most people agree that I'm lazy. The Greeks were distinguished nerds due to their obsession with the compass and straightedge. The question "what can we do with these tools" caused them to create a system of axioms and logical deduction. They assumed a few concepts, like "I can extend a line as far as I want" and "I can draw a circle around a point," and then they proceeded fairly rigorously to conclude more elaborate constructions.

While the geometrical conclusions of the Greeks are quite interesting (to nerds), their logical rigor was arguably the most distinguishing innovation in comparison to earlier nerds. Babylonians didn't clearly distinguish between approximations and exact solutions; the difference didn't really matter to them. The Greeks' logical system let them ask more general questions with completely exact answers.

An example would be Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem. For a right triangle with legs of length $a,b$ and hypotenuse of length $c$, it must be true that $a^2+b^2=c^2$. Euclid's proof by geometric argument was incontrovertable. If you accepted his (pretty reasonable) axioms, you could not deny this conclusion. This was a huge flex on the nerds of centuries past.

In the spirit of slandering the dead, I'd like to focus on the things that the Greeks did wrong. In particular, Plato's Platonic solids and Pythagoras's numerology. Plato (along with many others) thought the world was made of four elements, plus one: fire, earth, air, water, and the firmament. In *Timaeus*, Plato boldy claims that these five components of reality are each actually just geometric shapes. For example, fire is made of tetrahedra, because it feels pointy and hurts. I'll leave the other connections as an exercise to the reader.

As for Pythagoras's numerology, Pythagoras thought somewhat vaguely that all things were made of numbers. Pythagoras thought a lot of things, such as "you must not wear wool," "you must not poke fires with swords," "you must put the right sandal on before the left," and so on. He thought the firmament moved in accordance to mathematical equations that were equivalent to the sounds of a symphony, if only it could be decoded. He generally creeps me out a little bit, but we all have our quirks.

If these ideas are so obviously dated, why have I brought them up? To drag a deceased culture through the mud? Nay! I brought these up because they represent the revolutionary concept that there is a theory which connects experience to math. Our pacing, muttering ancestors were dancing with a mathematical theory of everything. While math was developing on its own thanks to the steady trickle of nerds, it was the hunt for a theory of everything that would eventually make mathematics into the powerhouse and commonplace annoyance we know today.
