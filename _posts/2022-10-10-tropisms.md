  An old free verse poem I wrote in 2017

# Tropisms

```
I am not gravitropic.
My body splays out, feeling,
Searching.
For what?
I am not phototropic.
I curl inward on myself;
These gnarled limbs entwine.
But I will find something,
Even if it is not the light,
As my bark scrapes along itself
Rendering the surface
So as to mark its way
```
