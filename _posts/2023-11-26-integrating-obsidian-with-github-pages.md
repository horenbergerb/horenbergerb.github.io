# Automated publication with Obsidian and Github Pages

I made a little docker container that periodically grabs my journal from Obsidian and automatically uploads it to my blog. This post is the first automatically-posted journal entry.

\[Here's the source on GitHub.\] It's not beautiful, but it is a functional proof of concept.

I'm pretty happy about this. I always wanted a way to make low-effort posts to my website so that I can almost use it like social media. I'm hoping to output more half-baked thoughts in the diary section of my blog. Things that might be interesting but are not worth a full writeup.
