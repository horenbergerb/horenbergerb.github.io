# Solving equations with the Lambert W function and GPT

## The problem and my solution

My girlfriend sent me this problem earlier and asked if it was solveable.

The presence of $ln(x)$ and $x$ tipped me off that it probably wasn't trivial to solve. I googled something like "solve equation with ln(x) and x" and stumbled upon the [Lambert W function.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function#:~:text=The%20Lambert%20W%20function%20is%20used%20to%20solve%20equations%20in,z%20using%20the%20W%20function.)

The takeaway was that a solution could be calculated in terms of W if I could wrangle things into the following form:

So I took a crack at it. Here's some half-ass wrangling I did on sticky notes:

This made it look pretty solveable. To bring it home:

This was enough to calculate $a_0$ and $c$. Then I could plug the whole equation into Wolfram Alpha, which can handle the Lambert W function. The end result was that $xpprox 7$, in case you're wondering.

## Can GPT solve it?

Short answer: no

I'll add the whole chat log here later. OpenAI is giving an error when I try to share.

I had a conversation with ChatGPT to see how far it could get. Even if it couldn't handle the algebra, could it give me the same tips as a Google search?

At first it hallucinated a simpler version of the problem which involved $\ln x$ but not $x$. Once I pointed this out, it corrected itself and rephrased the problem correctly.

Next it insisted that the solution was probably a transcendental equation recommended using numerical approximation. This is probably good general advice. I was sad it didn't mention the Lambert function though.

I tried encouraging it to find an algebraic solution, but it didn't attempt it, nor did it provide any clues or suggestions.

Finally, I got a little more direct to get what I was hoping to see:

So it is aware of Lambert functions, but it felt like a hollow victory.

Lastly, I pushed for an algebraic solution, and it ended up plugging the equation into sympy. The calculation timed out, but I was really surprised and impressed.

````python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, log, solve, lambertw

# Define the variable
x = symbols('x')

# Given constants in the equation from the image
a = 0.0178
b = 8.0973
c = 0.0732
d = 0.013
e = 13
f = 51.15

# Construct the equation: f = ln(x/a)/b - (c*x + d)/e
# To use the Lambert W function, we need to isolate the exponential term. We start by getting rid of the denominators.
equation = Eq(f * b * e, log(x/a) * e - (c*x + d) * b)

# Now we need to manipulate the equation into the form required for the Lambert W function
# which is: x * exp(x) = k. This typically involves isolating an exponential term and its coefficient.
# However, due to the complexity of the equation, this is not a straightforward task.

# Attempting to solve the equation directly might not give us a solution in terms of Lambert W,
# but let's try to solve it with sympy's solve function, which automatically applies Lambert W if possible.
solutions = solve(equation, x)

# If the solution involves the Lambert W function, it will be included in the solution.

I still need to run this myself and see if it works. I know there is at least a fixable import error.
