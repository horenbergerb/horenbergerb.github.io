# Obsidian dev ideas

* TOC

## News feeds

I was thinking it would be cool if I could specify the configuration for my RSS feeds inside Obsidian... But it's still gonna be a pain in the ass.

Really, I think I should add more feeds to see what kinds of generalizations I can make. Then maybe the optimal design will become clearer.

## Calendar integration

I could really use something like this. Need to think about how to do this and look into whether Google Calendar has APIs, etc

## LLM integration and RAG

So I've been scheming about how to get LLMs involved in this project for a while. I think it could be interesting if I designed a local model assistant which could access my notes. Trying to think of use cases is hard, but one example that comes to mind is my news feeds, particularly the feed of Arxiv papers.

Or, if the model were more attuned to my preferences:

I actually started implementing LLM integration today. I've got a simple scheme for having conversations with an LLM inside Obsidian using the llama.cpp api:

Excited to see how this develops.
