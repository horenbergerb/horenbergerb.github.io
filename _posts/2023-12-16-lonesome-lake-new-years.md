Winter hiking, cozy fireplaces, and lots of snow!

December 31st, 2023 - January 1st 2023

# Who?

Hopefully you! There are currently ONLY 6 spots open for reservation as of 12/16/23, but they go fast. An overnight stay costs ~$60 per person and must be booked in advance.

Current attendees are Erin and I plus maybe Carly, but please let me know if you want to RSVP for the remaining 3 spots!

# I want to go!

Fantastic! Text Erin Rehm or Beau Horenberger and let us know! We need to book tickets as soon as possible or they will sell out.

# What will we do?

## Day 1: Hiking in and chilling

We will probably try to start hiking at about 11AM.
[Here is where we will park.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tLpHjePnTA9UYykK6)

Our hike to the hut is short at about 1.5 miles, but it is uphill. The route is illustrated in red here:

And here is the elevation profile:

Once we get to the hut, we can chill and play games, walk around the lake, or hike Cannon Mountain if we feel ambitious.

We are gonna bring food to cook a fun dinner in the fully-stocked kitchen. You can bring foods which need refrigeration like meats.

## Day 2: Hiking out (and getting dank breakfast?)

On day two, we will casually pack up and head back down, probably getting to the cars around 11? Although we are flexible. Then we will get some breakfast in Lincoln and meander back to Boston.

You are also welcome to do whatever. There are multiple ski hills nearby, lots of hiking, and Lincoln is a fun town to check out. Maybe we'll join you! We don't have an itinerary.

# What do I need?

*Winter hiking and camping requires preparation. You must plan carefully to avoid consequences.*

I'm gonna have to flesh this list out over the next few days. Check out the [Lonesome Lake Hut Webpage](https://www.outdoors.org/destinations/new-hampshire/lonesome-lake-hut/?campaign=7012J000001CIGRQA4&utm_source=google&utm_medium=performance-max&utm_campaign=do-something-indescribable&utm_content=adventure&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAsvWrBhC0ARIsAO4E6f-QPjPUEIITt7lZkEE2o-VM69NdsvjOchrVJ5_o8M6hmx-Qy0Xf0RAaAhllEALw_wcB) to get started. Some big items that come to mind are:

* A sleeping bag rated for extremely cold temperatures, probably like a 0 degree bag
* Sleeping pad is optional since we are in bunks
* Microspikes for traction
* A headlamp
* A backpacking bag
* Many warm layers
* A little pillow
* Food (we can all coordinate this)
* A can-do attitude and a willingness to hike up to two hours each day on steep terrain.
* Hiking poles would be nice
* 1 or 2 liters of water. There is water at the shelter.

# Pictures

The main lodge where we can hang out. Stone-heated, usually until 10PM. Features a fully stocked kitchen and lots of tables. Usually all ~32 beds are booked, so it can get bumping in here.

The bunks where we will sleep. Unheated, but warmer than outside.

That's all for now!
