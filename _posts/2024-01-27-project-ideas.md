# Project ideas

* TOC
{:toc}


I want to do something fresh. It might be nice to get back into math or pull on some stuff I learned in college but haven't been using. Here are some ideas I've gotten:

* Redo my [inscribed rectangle proof visualizations](https://horenbergerb.github.io/2020/07/14/inscribedrectangle.html) using web visualization tools. p5.js seems like the obvious candidate. It would be a nice way to start developing more advanced interactive web content
* Signal processing projects
  * ["filtering and squishing multiple .wav files into a "radio.wav" file and then applying BPF's to extract individual signals"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/r0jktr/need_project_ideas_for_signals_and_system/)
  * Something involving EEG signals? Could also do ML here
  * Noise cancellation or denoising
  * Could also do image processing from the signals perspective. Filtering out features or something, I dunno
  * Could try to isolate certain sounds from a complex audio signal
  * [Inverse problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06001)
* Read from Andrew Gelman's Bayesian statistics. Make more Bayesian models
* I could marry the signal processing stuff with the p5.js stuff. What if there was a box where you can draw an image, and then another box renders the FFT in real time?
  * Or you could draw a 1D signal or something
