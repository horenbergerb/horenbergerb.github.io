[Fifty Famous Curves](https://elepa.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/fifty-famous-curves.pdf)

[Descartes's "The Geometry,"](https://download.tuxfamily.org/openmathdep/geometry_analytic/The_Geometry-Descartes.pdf) the book which invented algebra as we know it today. Before this, people literally did multiplication geometrically with a compass and straightedge.

[How does one visualize a function with a discontinuous second derivative?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/331314/how-does-one-visualize-a-function-with-a-discontinuous-second-derivative)

[Selected correspondences of Descartes](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/descartes1619_2.pdf) Descartes was absolutely savage.

[How did Descartes know what sort of curve an equation traces?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2004697/how-did-descartes-know-what-sort-of-a-curve-an-equation-traces)

That last one answered the question I had originally set out to investigate. I wanted to know how Descartes defined the [folium of Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folium_of_Descartes) at the time, since math was communicated very differently back then.

It's an interesting way of going about things. It seems like BC=x, CD=y, so I guess D is the origin? I still want to dig in further and figure out exactly what he was doing with this construction.

You can find the complete letter which defines the folium in [this book.](https://archive.org/details/oeuvresdefermat02ferm/page/128/mode/2up) The full definition starts at the very bottom of page 129.

Credit also to [this paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4145129) which tipped me off to the particular letter before I found the StackExchange post that identified the definition.
