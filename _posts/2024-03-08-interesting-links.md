[Calculating Entropy of a file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/990477/how-to-calculate-the-entropy-of-a-file)
Can I make an ML algorithm that predicts entropy? Would it be meaningful to do so?

[Elliptic Curve ‘Murmurations’ Found With AI Take Flight](https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/)
I have a lot to say about elliptic curves

[The Joy of Why podcast by Steven Strogatz](https://www.stevenstrogatz.com/media/podcasts/category/The+Joy+of+Why)

[New Math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math)
In an episode of that Strogatz podcast about "what is good math" with Terence Tao, Tao talks about the era of New Math (1950s-1970s?) and has a name for the era, but I didn't hear it clearly so I can't google it. I listened to it again at 2x speed to find the word while writing this page, but I didn't catch it. *Please listen to the podcast and tell me what the word was.*

[What are holonomic and non-holonomic constraints?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/409951/what-are-holonomic-and-non-holonomic-constraints)

[Rapidly-exloring random trees](http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/~lavalle/papers/LavKuf01.pdf)
This paper has a dope theoretical approach to a broad category of path planning problems.

[Gaspard Monge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspard_Monge)
The father of differential geometry and technical drawing.

[Did Gauss try to determine whether physical space is non-euclidean?](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/462359/what-is-the-likely-error-of-the-triangulation-of-gauss-survey)
I also liked that the top answer introduced the notion of spherical excess, a concept with consequences in how we measure the shape of our planet. The measurement of spherical excess was supposedly something Gauss solved using his knowledge of differential geometry.

[Gauss map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_map)

[Constrained Bimanual Planning with Analytic Inverse Kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08770)
I met the guy who co-authored this at the climbing gym. He was cool and his work sounds cool.
