[A paper on control vectors, a new hot topic for local LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405)

I haven't had much luck fiddling with control vectors, and I haven't seen any promising reports. They are relatively easy to train and use now. Curious if their efficacy has been overstated or if people just don't understand how to train them yet.
