<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Recently I had the idea that I might appreciate mathematics more if I understood how it originated. “I’m so clever,” I thought, “I’ll just Google ‘Ancient Egyptian Mathematics’ and then everything will make sense.” Surprise! Nobody has a complete understanding of Egyptian mathematics. There are many mysteries about how Egyptians performed mathematical operations and how Egyptians understood mathematics.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, I’m beginning to suspect that there’s not a simple solution. I’m not going to have a breakthrough and think “Oh, <em>that’s</em> what mathematics meant to Egyptians!” The deeper I dig, the more mysteries present themselves…</p>

<p>As such, this series of blog posts is an attempt to document my experience of digging ever deeper in search of answers which don’t exist. I wanted this first post to provide a little exposition about ancient Egyptian civilization and an overview of what the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP) contains.</p>

<p>I’ll warn you now; this first post is going to lean on Wikipedia really hard. Deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>We start with a very brief history of Egypt from its origin up to the point at which the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus was written. Next we describe the RMP and discuss simple observations about the problems it contained.</p>

<h2 id="egypt-a-timeline-up-to-the-rmp">Egypt: A Timeline Up To The RMP</h2>

<p>Set the scene in Egypt, along the Nile, nearly 5000 years ago. Already for thousands of years, large cultures along the Nile have been practicing agriculture and animal husbandry, making pottery, and generally having a good time. There were stone, copper, and obsidians tools, there was jewelry and painted ceramics, and there was an ongoing consolidation of power around the Nile valley.</p>

<p>In passing, note that the earliest known Hieroglyphic writing appeared suddenly in 3250BC, already a complete writing system. Its origins are unknown.<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/ALLEN2014MiddleEgyptianAnIntroductionToTheLanguageAndCultureOfHieroglyphs/mode/2up">3</a></sup></p>

<p>We will boldly proclaim the beginning of Egyptian civilization to be placed around 3000BC, in what is called the Early Dynastic Period. At this point, power in Egyptian society began to consolidate under Dynastic kings. There were more elaborately constructed tombs and government institutions.</p>

<p>Around 2686BC, things really started to take off during the Old Kingdom period of Egypt. “Major advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the Old Kingdom, fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.”<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">1</a></sup> Shit like the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx happened next. There were large, coordinated government operations involving collecting taxes (mathematics is important for taxes).</p>

<p>Next there was government collapse, food shortages, re-emergence of organized societies, more kings, innovation in the arts, weakening, introduction of the composite bow (by the invading Hyksos), war campaigns, and eventually prosperity by the time you reach 1500BC. It was a busy era.</p>

<h2 id="the-rhind-mathematical-papyrus">The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</h2>

<p>This happens to be around the time that the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (RMP) was written. The RMP is basically a huge scroll detailing many mathematical problems and solutions. Its design suggests that it was intended to be used by a teacher to assign problems to students.<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/ALLEN2014MiddleEgyptianAnIntroductionToTheLanguageAndCultureOfHieroglyphs/mode/2up">3</a></sup> It was written near 1550BC.</p>

<p>The original RMP is lost. The oldest copy that exists today was written by a scribe, Ahmes, approximately 200 years after the original RMP was written. The scroll itself is about 13 inches tall and would have been 13 ft long altogether.</p>

<p>The RMP is one of the major bodies of evidence about ancient Egyptian math. It contains diverse mathematical problems, notably including story problems.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-egyptians-use-math">How Did Egyptians Use Math?</h3>

<p>What kind of problems were the Egyptians solving with math? Many of the problems in RMP were about measurement of length, area, and volume. They also measured slope (degree of flatness) and “lack of quality indicating a dilution factor in such commodities as bread and beer.”<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/rhindmathematica0000robi_h8l4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>All of these measurements have convenient practical motivations. Area, in particular, was used in taxation.<sup><a href="https://daily.jstor.org/tax-day-ancient-egypt/">5</a></sup> A government agent, the “holder of the cord,” would measure the area of property where grain was grown, and the property owner would be taxed a percentage of their total crop.</p>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center"><em>Taxation goes way back<sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/rhindmathematica0000robi_h8l4">4</a></sup></em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Volume was commonly used for measuring grain or flower as well as liquids such as beer. For example, RMP 42 computes the volume of a circular granary in terms of barrels.<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8c10QYoGa4UC">6</a></sup> This kind of math would be useful for knowing how much grain your kingdom possesses and preventing famines and governmental collapse.</p>

<p>Some of the problems are simply about how to equally split 6 loaves of bread among 10 men.<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8c10QYoGa4UC">6</a></sup></p>

<p>However, some of the problems appear to be purely about mathematics itself. The first entry of the RMP is called the “2/n table.” This table is a calculation of how to represent $\frac{2}{n}$ as the sum of unique unit fractions for values of $n$ between 2 and 101. We show the solutions calculated in the 2/n table.</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/2n_table.png" alt="The formulae from the 2/n table" /></th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This may seem quite mystical, but in fact one can rationalize about why the Egyptians studied these. The Egyptian numerical system motivated</p>
