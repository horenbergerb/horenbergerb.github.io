# Diffusion Models

## An Extremely Roundabout Introduction

Let's begin by pretending we have some natural probability distribution, $q(\mathbf{x})$. For example, let's say it's the probability distribution of cat images. If we feed it a cat image, it tells us how likely this cat image is to be encountered (this is far more abstract than I'm making it sound).

Suppose we sample $\mathbf{x}_0 \sim q(\mathbf{x})$. Then we add a little normally-distributed noise to $\mathbf{x}_0$ and get $\mathbf{x}_1$.



If our noise is $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x};0, \beta)$, then the conditional probability of $\mathbf{x}_1$ given $\mathbf{x}_0$ is $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x_0};0, \beta)$
