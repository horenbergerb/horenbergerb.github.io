# Minecraft as Conferencing Software

## To Be Young Again

It has always been my perverted fantasy to host an academic presentation in Minecraft. No, I will not rationalize or explain this desire. Just imagine it for a moment. You're in Minecraft. You're a child again. You're discovering your own creative ability. Except you're also attending a lecture. You're afraid of getting called on. The presenter is already 5 minutes over with no signs of stopping. This is my dream.

Really, though, why am I doing this? If I had to rationalize it on the spot, it would be something like this:

Minecraft pushed me to be creative as a kid. I remember engineering my first house. I remember joining servers and building towns. I even got into roleplay, where we fabricated entire identities and social dynamics. It was my first encounter with communities of creators where I felt like I belonged.

Jump forward 12 years. I'm still a creator today, although my interests have developed and drifted over time. But it's only natural that I still feel a yearning for my old stomping ground.

After all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep playing Minecraft? But if I can't return to the naive child I once was, I'll have to bring my baggage with me. Which is why we're here, and why I've written a server plugin for rendering LaTeX equations in Minecraft, henceforth known as [AcademiCraft](https://github.com/horenbergerb/AcademiCraft).

## AcademiCraft

Like most problems in life, rendering LaTeX in Minecraft was simplified by stealing. I piggy-backed off an existing Spigot plugin, [ImageOnMap](https://github.com/zDevelopers/ImageOnMap), which is capable of rendering images as maps in Minecraft.

I won't bore you with the nitty gritty. Suffice to say that my plugin is certainly a liability for any server owner and probably a nightmare to set up. This only adds to the intrigue, as AcademiCraft servers are consequently hard to find and quite exclusive.
