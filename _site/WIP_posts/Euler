# 1700s Math 1: Euler, Transcendental Functions, Infinite Series

## Introduction

I think one of the reasons early math feels so obscure is because their perspective was radically different than ours. Until the 1600s, math was largely geometric, and there was very little formal notation. Rene Descartes (1596-1650) was one of the first people to show how well algebraic notation can relate to a geometrical problem.

Descartes created the Cartesian coordinate system. This finally let people use an x-axis and a y-axis, and thus, a circle could be defined by $x^2+y^2=0$ rather than by saying "a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are a given distance from a given point" or by using a compass.

It's important to understand that Descartes wasn't just encouraging people to say $x$ rather than "the length of the side of the square," but that he demonstrated *all of our geometric problems could be phrased this way,* and he told us how to translate them. By this point in history, we had a lot of geometric problems.

Cartesian coordinates created a new mathematical perspective. People immediately began working on polynomial and rational equations, since these flowed naturally out of ancient geometric problems. There was probably an interest in translating classical geometric results with algebraic tools.

There were new questions caused by the change in notation. For example, it was discovered every quadratic equation in Cartesian coordinates is a conic section. Could other sets of equations be classified similarly? When could equations be solved formulaically?

This is the era in which Euler (1707-1783) reigned. He quite literally wrote the book on investigations in algebra. Particularly, algebra opened the door to analytical methods such as infinite series, integration, and differentiation, and Euler formalized these practices and leveraged them to create amazing results.

This was the time when it became clear there were some functions that could not be represented using standard algebra, but only through infinite series. We'll talk about $\sin$ and $\cos$, and then we'll possibly talk about $e$ and $\log$.

We might then explore Euler's other adventures with infinite series.
