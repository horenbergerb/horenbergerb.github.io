Hi, I'm Beau Horenberger. I like math, math history, climbing, skiing, computer science, and probably some other stuff. I did my undergrad at University of Idaho in general mathematics (grad. May 2019), promptly thought "oh god what am I doing", and returned to get my masters in electrical and computer engineering from Boston University (grad. Dec 2022). Now I'm currently working in industry doing fun computer vision things.

I'm very interested in the motivations behind math. How did different mathematical practices come into being? Why are we interested in particular  mathematical concepts? What makes math "intuitive" in certain contexts? Pondering these questions is an excellent way to kill a lot of time.

I also do other stuff, and I rant about some of it publicly. I enjoy following the developments in machine learning. [I trained GPT-2 to imitate my friends](https://github.com/horenbergerb/FriendSimulator). I've also designed a custom ML algorithm to perform high-speed video segmentation on a live feed of Runescape. You can check out the paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14LsWzqAO1FZIG-KbWYlGT2TAjHHjzMLX/view?usp=sharing) or view the source [here](https://github.com/horenbergerb/OSRS_Optical_Recognition).

But let's be real: I'm here to goof around. That's the bottom line. I'm gonna post whatever I want, and I'm not gonna think about it too hard.

It has been brought to my attention I am wrong most of the time.
