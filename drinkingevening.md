Hello and welcome to the official Drinking Evening page! Here you can find all kinds of information or simply fantasize about the good times to come.  

## What is Drinking Evening? <a name="1.0"></a>

Drinking Evening is an attempt to hold safe, fun events with cheap drinks and good friends. Some of the highlights of Drinking evening:

* House-provided mixed and canned drinks; recommended donations of \$1-\$3 (See menu)
* Spacious, well-ventilated venue
* Incredibly handsome hosts
* Up to 15 of those people you like in attendance  

## Where, when? How do I get there? <a name="2.0"></a>

* **When:** October 2nd, 2020 at 7:30PM
* **Where:** 10 Saunders St., Allston, MA, 02134

Free overnight parking can be found along Cambridge St, with some luck. The 57 bus stops within 100 meters. The Green B Line is a 10-15 minute walk.  

## What do I need to do? <a name="3.0"></a>

Before attending you *must* RSVP with Beau Horenberger due to the occupancy limit.

Please bring cash for recommended donations. Additionally, contact Beau with ideas/requests for house-provided drinks. Most importantly, please be ready to party hardy. Also, see "Is it safe?" for guidance on how to minimize risk by preparing in advance.  

## What are the house-provided drinks? <a name="4.0"></a>

The house offers a small selection of mixed and canned drinks.

We are taking suggestions for which drinks to provide. Here is a rough draft of a menu:

* Truly Seltzer (\$2 recommended donation)
* Rum and Coke (\$2 recommended donation)
* Some generic beer (\$2 recommended donation)
* Margaritas (\$3 recommended donation)  

## Is it safe? <a name="5.0"></a>

Any gathering is inherently risky. We are taking steps to minimize risk, and you can help. Here are some of the measures we take:

* Bartenders at work wear face masks, gloves
* Maximum attendance of 15 people (currently all LEAPers + my roommates)
* Extremely spacious venue (3 large interconnected rooms)
* Intermittently opened windows in every room

Here are some of the measures we recommend you take:

* Schedule your COVID test shortly before the event.
* Avoid risky environments in the week before attending
* Minimize physical contact; take advantage of the open space
* Don't attend if you are experiencing symptoms (There will always be another Drining Evening!)
