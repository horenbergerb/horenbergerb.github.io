# Drinking Evening

Hello and welcome to the official Drinking Evening page! Here you can find all kinds of information or simply fantasize about the good times to come.

### What is Drinking Evening?

Drinking Evening is an attempt to hold safe, fun events with cheap drinks and good friends. Some of the highlights of Drinking evening:

* House-provided mixed and canned drinks; recommended donations of $1-$3 (See menu)
* Spacious, well-ventilated venue
* Incredibly handsome hosts
* Up to 15 of those people you like in attendance

### Where, when? How do I get there?

* **When** October 2nd, 2020 at 7:30PM
* **Where** 10 Saunders St., Allston, MA, 02134

Free overnight parking can be found along Cambridge St, with some luck.

### What do I need to do?

Before attending you *must* RSVP with Beau Horenberger due to the occupancy limit.

Please bring cash for recommended donations. Additionally, contact Beau with ideas for house-provided drinks. Most importantly, please be ready to party hardy. Also, see "Is it safe?" for guidance on how to minimize risk by preparing in advance.

### What are these house-provided drinks you mention?

The house offers a small selection of mixed and canned drinks. Every drink has a recommended donation, typically between $1-$3.

We are taking suggestions for which drinks to provide. Here is a rough draft of a menu:

* Truly Seltzer ($2 recommended donation)
* Rum and Coke ($2 recommended donation)
* Some generic beer ($2 recommended donation)
* Margaritas ($3 recommended donation)

### Is it safe?

Any gathering is inherently risky. We are taking steps to minimize risk, and you can help. Here are some of the measures we take:

* Bartenders at work wear face masks, gloves
* Maximum attendance of 15 people (currently all LEAPers)
* Extremely spacious venue (3 large interconnected rooms)

Here are some of the measures we recommend you take:

* Schedule your COVID test shortly before the event.
* Avoid risky environments in the week before attending
* Minimize physical contact; take advantage of the open space
* Don't attend if you are experiencing symptoms (There will always be another Drining Evening!)
