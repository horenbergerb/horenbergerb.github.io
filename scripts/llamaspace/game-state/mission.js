The player is Donald Wobbleton, captain of a small starship known as the Galileo. The Galileo is on a research mission in a remote part of the galaxy. The starship is similar in capabilities to the Federation starship Enterprise from Star Trek, albeit smaller and lower quality (it's one of the oldest ships in the fleet). It was designed for a crew of 15.

The Galileo is equipped with standard research equipment and meagre weaponry. It has a small replicator and two shuttlecraft. It has most of the resources needed to sustain a crew of 15 for a year.

Current Ship Status:
Inventory:
${Object.entries(this.currentInventory).map(([item, amount]) => `- ${item}`).join('\n')}

Shuttlecraft:
${this.shuttleStatus.map(shuttle => `- ${shuttle.name}`).join('\n')}

Donald, his ship, and his crew are all nobodies. Donald's promotion to captain was something of a nepotism scandal. His crew is composed of misfits and those with complicated pasts in the service. The ship itself is old and worn out, but everyone on board is used to getting the short end of the stick. This research mission to the D-124 star system is an exile, but it's also a chance for the entire crew to redeem themselves.

Rate the difficulty from 1 to 10. This represents the likelihood of failure. 10 indicates an impossible task, 5 is harder than average, 1 is a trivial task.

Additionally, rate the quality of the mission from 1 to 10. High-quality missions ask interesting questions regarding the body that the Galileo is orbiting. Low-quality missions are irrelevant to the body, trivial, or uninteresting.

Finally, rate the danger of the mission from 1 to 10. This is the likelihood of consequences such as loss of equipment, injury, or death. 1 indicates no danger, 10 indicates catastrophic losses, and 5 is a moderate level of danger.

Format your response exactly like this:

Considerations: *Reason about the difficulty of the mission*
Difficulty: X

Considerations: *Reason about the quality of the mission*
Quality: Y

Considerations: *Reason about the danger of the mission*
Danger: Z

Donald assigned a research mission to a bridge crew member named ${this.assignedCrew.name}. ${this.assignedCrew.name} is a ${this.assignedCrew.race}. ${this.assignedCrew.races[this.assignedCrew.race].description}

${this.assignedCrew.name} is often described as ${this.assignedCrew.demeanor.join(", ")}.

${difficultyDescription} The research mission was a ${this.outcome ? 'success' : 'failure'}.

Approved resource allocations for the mission:
${Object.entries(this.requirements).map(([item, quantity]) => `- ${quantity} ${item}`).join('\n')}

${!this.outcome ? `During the mission, the following losses were incurred:
${Object.entries(this.failureConsequences.inventoryLosses).map(([item, amount]) => `- Lost ${amount} ${item}`).join('\n')}
${Object.entries(this.failureConsequences.shuttleDamage).map(([shuttleId, damage]) => {
    const isDestroyed = destroyedShuttles.includes(shuttleId);
    return `- Shuttle ${shuttleId} sustained ${damage} damage${isDestroyed ? ' and was destroyed' : ''}`;
}).join('\n')}
` : 'None of the allocated resources were lost.'}

Here was the mission objective:

Objective: ${this.objective}

The research mission was documented in ${Math.max(1, this.difficulty + Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) - 2)} phases.

Each phase should be phrased as a progress report from ${this.assignedCrew.name} written in their log. It should be a single sentence or two.
Format your response exactly like this, with one step per line starting with a number and period:

1. First report
2. Second report here
etc.

Keep steps clear and actionable. Write them in plaintext with no titles or other formatting. The number of steps should reflect task complexity relative to standard operations. Routine tasks like planetary surveys are simpler and have fewer steps. Be realistic about what is possible for the Galileo. The steps of this mission should be creatively and stylistically distinct from the steps of recent missions on this body.`;
