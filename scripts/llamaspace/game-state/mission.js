The player is Donald, captain of a small starship known as the Galileo. The Galileo is on a research mission in a remote part of the galaxy. The starship is similar in capabilities to the Federation starship Enterprise from Star Trek, albeit smaller and lower quality (it's one of the oldest ships in the fleet). It was designed for a crew of 15.

The Galileo is equipped with standard research equipment and meagre weaponry. It has a small replicator and two shuttlecraft. It has most of the resources needed to sustain a crew of 15 for a year.

Current Ship Status:
Inventory:
${Object.entries(this.currentInventory).map(([item, amount]) => `- ${item}: ${amount} available`).join('\n')}

Shuttlecraft:
${this.shuttleStatus.map(shuttle => `- ${shuttle.name}: ${shuttle.health} health`).join('\n')}

Donald, his ship, and his crew are all nobodies. Donald's promotion to captain was something of a nepotism scandal. His crew is composed of misfits and those with complicated pasts in the service. The ship itself is old and worn out, but everyone on board is used to getting the short end of the stick. This research mission to the D-124 star system is an exile, but it's also a chance for the entire crew to redeem themselves.

What equipment was lost and what damage occurred to the shuttlecraft during this failed mission?

Consider the difficulty (${this.difficulty}/10) when determining losses. More difficult missions should have more severe consequences.

Consider current shuttle health when determining damage - total health cannot go below 0.
