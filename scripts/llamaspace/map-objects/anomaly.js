The player is Donald Wobbleton, captain of a small starship known as the Galileo. The Galileo is on a research mission in a remote part of the galaxy. The starship is similar in capabilities to the Federation starship Enterprise from Star Trek, albeit smaller and lower quality (it's one of the oldest ships in the fleet). It was designed for a crew of 15.

The Galileo is equipped with standard research equipment and meagre weaponry. It has a small replicator and two shuttlecraft. It has most of the resources needed to sustain a crew of 15 for a year.

Current Ship Status:
Inventory:
${Object.entries(this.currentInventory).map(([item, amount]) => `- ${item}: ${amount} available`).join('\n')}

Shuttlecraft:
${this.shuttleStatus.map(shuttle => `- ${shuttle.name}: ${shuttle.health} health`).join('\n')}

Donald, his ship, and his crew are all nobodies. Donald's promotion to captain was something of a nepotism scandal. His crew is composed of misfits and those with complicated pasts in the service. The ship itself is old and worn out, but everyone on board is used to getting the short end of the stick. This research mission to the D-124 star system is an exile, but it's also a chance for the entire crew to redeem themselves.

The ship has become aware of an anomaly on or near the body. Anomalies can be natural phenomena, artificial structures, a ship in distress, or anything else of note. The term encapsulates any encounter beyond the norm, of which there are many in this part of the galaxy. These are some of the properties of the anomaly:

Severity: ${this.severity}
Descriptors: ${this.adjectives}
Location: ${this.location}
${reportStyleContext.length > 0 ? `Additional Context:\n${reportStyleContext.join('\n')}\n` : ''}
The crew of the Galileo does not necessarily know all of this. The bridge crew is completing preliminary scans of the anomaly. Write two or three sentences from the science officer to Captain Wobbleton describing what they've found. The report should focus on what they can see and, optionally, a few key measurements made by the science officer, focusing on the most significant and concerning aspects of the anomaly. Use creative license to make the anomaly interesting and mysterious, but make it tangible and believable. This report should be totally distinct from the recent reports on other anomalies, and the delivery should be unique.

${this.reportStyleHint}

Format your response as two or thre sentences with no additional text or formatting. It's a verbal report only moments after the anomaly was detected.`;
